# object_oriented-programming
This is an object_oriented programming with javascript using the encapsulation principle
In this project i used one of the principle of object oriented programing to differntiate the animal kingdom starting from the class, i implemented a method of geting the data from the constructor and seting the date to b elong the its kingdom.
i differnted it also from the console, so that it wont appear together when being called.
its a flexible and a small line of code with a cool functionality.
